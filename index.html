            My name is Derrick, I'm currently working as a Clinical Systems Analyst.
            I spend the majority of my time at work fixing technial issues with our horrible EHR system,
            making amendments to our company website, and integrating new software for the comapny.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not at work, I spend my time coding, playing video games, and gambling. C++ is my go-to programming language.
            When my eyes grow weary from gazing into the abyss of my visual studio IDE, I crank up the XBOX One. 
            My favorite video games consist of Halo 2, NBA 2K, and Destiny 2. I completely obliterate the competition everytime!
        </p>
        <p> 
            I hit the casino every chance I get! Some call it an addiction, I call it winning! I usually win $300-$2500 evertime I play.
            I count cards playing Blackjack and use perfect strategy when I play Video Poker. Life is a gamble fo why not gamble.
